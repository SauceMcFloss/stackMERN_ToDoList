# stackMERN_ToDoList
A basic to-do list using the MERN stack<br />
Follows this tutorial: https://scotch.io/@deityhub/getting-started-with-the-mern-stack#toc-running-the-react-app
<br />
This is missing the node modules, but those can be installed by running the commands<br />
"npm init" and/or "npm install" in the root directory. I'm not sure which does what.
